 * interaction with other floated elements on the page that may be used
 * for layout.

 * For our default style, each tab is positioned relatively 1 pixel down from
 * where it wold normally render. This allows each tab to overlap the content
 * panel that renders below it. Each tab is rendered with a 1 pixel bottom
 * border that has a color that matches the top border of the current content
 * panel. This gives the appearance that the tab is being drawn behind the
 * content panel.
